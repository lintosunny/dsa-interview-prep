# Data Structures & Algorithms Prep for ML/AI Engineers

This repository is a structured collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems, organized by **problem-solving patterns**. It is designed to help **ML Engineers, AI Engineers, and MLEs** build strong problem-solving skills for coding interviews.  

## Why This Repo?
- Focused on **problem-solving patterns** rather than random problems.  
- Covers **essential topics** needed for ML/AI/Software Engineering interviews.  
- Includes **LeetCode references** for practice.  
- Easy-to-navigate **folder structure** with consistent naming.
